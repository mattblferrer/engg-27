ENGG 27: Advanced Engineering Math with Numerical Methods
  - Project 1: Smallest and Largest Numbers
    - Generates the smallest and largest doubles that can be stored by C++ without using constants in the C++ standard library.
  - Project 2: Parabolic Fit
    - Generates the best fit parabola for a given set of points, defined by an input file.
  - Project 3: Roots of Polynomials
    - Uses the Durand-Kerner method to solve for all roots of a given polynomial at once, using a polynomial format file.
